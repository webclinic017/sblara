Contact Form 7 - Add useful modules such as hidden fields and "send all fields" to the Contact Form 7 plugin

== Description ==

### Add Hidden Fields to Contact Form 7

The Contact Form 7 plugin has over <em>8.4 million</em> downloads, yet the great plugin still lacks a simple feature: <strong>hidden fields</strong>. This plugin adds hidden fields to Contact Form 7 once and for all.

#### Inserting dynamic values

You can also choose to have the value of the hidden field dynamically populated in your form when you are contacted. To do so, choose the "Default value" to be:

* `post_title` - Inserts the title of the post/page
* `post_category` - The categories of the post or page
* `post_url` - The URL of the post or page
* `post_author` - The author of the post or page
* `custom_field-[Name]` - The value of a post or page's custom field. If you had a custom field "Foo", you would use the following as the hidden field value: `custom_field-Foo`

The following values will be replaced if an user is logged in:

* `user_name`: User Login
* `user_id`: User ID
* `user_email`: User Email Address
* `user_display_name`: Display Name (Generally the first and last name of the user)
* `user_url`: User Website

And you can also use it for user custom meta data using the format of `user-{field}`:

* `user-aim`: AIM
* `user-jabber`: Jabber / Google Talk
* `user-description`: User Bio

<strong>You can also use a filter:</strong> hook into the `wpcf7_hidden_field_value` filter to modify the value of the hidden field  using <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter" rel="nofollow"><code>add_filter()</code></a>. If you know the ID of the input, you can also use the `wpcf7_hidden_field_value_[#ID]` filter.

Now, when someone contacts you using your Contact Form 7 contact form, you can have lots more information about their visit - and you'll see it when you receive the email that tells you you've been contacted.

### Easily Send All Submitted Fields At Once

####Save time setting up your form emails...and never miss a field!

One of the limitations of Contact Form 7 is that you need to manually add each field to generated emails. This means that if you update the form with a new field and forget to add it to your email message, you won't receive it in your email. <strong>No longer.</strong>.

Using the <strong>Send All Fields</strong> module, you simply need to add `[all-fields]` to your message, and you will receive every field submitted. If you use HTML formatting, the formatting even looks nice.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I turn off formatting the key in the `[all-fields]` output? =
Add the following to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
add_filter('wpcf7_send_all_fields_format_key', '__return_false');
`

= How do I set non-standard user data as hidden field values? =

Starting with Version 1.4, you can access user data, including meta data.

You need to set the default value as: `user-{meta_key}` where `{meta_key}` is the key of the meta field you want the value of.

To get the values of WordPress default profile fields, for example, you would use:

* `user-aim` - AOL
* `user-jabber` - Jabber / Google Talk
* `user-description` - Biographical description

= What is the plugin license? =

* This plugin is released under a GPL license.

= Is the plugin available in other languages? =

Not yet, so [help translate the plugin!](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/contact-form-7-modules/)

= How do I send empty values with the `[all-fields]` shortcode? =

Add this to your `functions.php` file: `add_filter('wpcf7_send_all_fields_send_empty_fields', '__return_true');`

= How do I modify the output of the `[all-fields]` shortcode? =

* `wpcf7_send_all_fields_format_before` - Before the loop of fields (`<dl>` for HTML output)
	* `$value` _string_ Previous output
	* `$format` _string_ Either "html" or "text"
* `wpcf7_send_all_fields_format_item` - Change each item output. Passes four arguments:
	* `$value` _string_ Previous output
	* `$k` _string_ Field label
	* `$v` _string_ Value of the field
	* `$format` _string_ Either "html" or "text"
* `wpcf7_send_all_fields_format_after` - After the loop of fields (`</dl>` for HTML output). Passes two arguments:
	* `$value` _string_ Previous output
	* `$format` _string_ Either "html" or "text"
